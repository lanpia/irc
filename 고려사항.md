4.1 Connection Registration

   The commands described here are used to register a connection with an
   IRC server as either a user or a server as well as correctly
   disconnect.

   A "PASS" command is not required for either client or server
   connection to be registered, but it must precede the server message
   or the latter of the NICK/USER combination.  It is strongly
   recommended that all server connections have a password in order to
   give some level of security to the actual connections.  The
   recommended order for a client to register is as follows:

           1. Pass message
           2. Nick message
           3. User message
